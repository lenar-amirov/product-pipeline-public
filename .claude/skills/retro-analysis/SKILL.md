# Retrospective Analysis Skill

## Purpose
Generate a data-grounded retrospective brief that separates facts from feelings, so the team spends retro time on solutions rather than debating what happened.

## Required Inputs
- Sprint tickets: planned vs. completed
- Carry-over tickets and reasons
- Tickets reopened after closing
- Any incidents or unplanned work
- Sprint velocity vs. historical average

## Process
1. Calculate: completion rate, carry-over rate, unplanned work percentage
2. Identify patterns: which ticket types were most likely to carry over? Which caused blockers?
3. Note any process or communication breakdowns visible in the data
4. Prepare 3 "Start / Stop / Continue" prompts based on the data — not generic, specific to this sprint
5. Suggest 1 concrete experiment for the next sprint based on the biggest friction point

## Output Format

### Sprint [Number] Retrospective Brief

**By the Numbers:**
- Planned: [n] tickets | Completed: [n] | Carry-over: [n] | Completion rate: [%]
- Unplanned work: [n] tickets ([%] of capacity)
- Velocity: [points] vs. [average] average

**What the Data Suggests:**
[2-3 observations grounded in the numbers above]

**Discussion Prompts:**
- Start: [specific prompt]
- Stop: [specific prompt]
- Continue: [specific prompt]

**Suggested Experiment for Next Sprint:**
[One concrete, testable process change]
